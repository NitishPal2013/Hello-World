## Some Important tools used by Mathematicians

For visualising there are some softwares which helps to plot functions and analyses becomes so easy. These are listed below.

# WOLFRAM MATHEMATICA
Wolfram Mathematica is a software system with built-in libraries for several areas of technical computing that allow machine learning, statistics, symbolic computation, data manipulation, network analysis, time series analysis, plotting functions and various types of data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other programming languages.

This software system is very easy to learn and use as it comes built-in libraries which provides easy to use funcitons.You should definitely try it once.

# MATLAB
MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.
